: I want to improve my eCommerce website (ZUBI - ZU Business Industries) using only frontend technologies (HTML, CSS, JS). Please add the following features:

🧾 1. Payment Integration Page (Frontend Only)
When the user clicks on "Proceed to Payment", instead of showing an alert, redirect to a payment page that includes a full payment form with styling and animations.

The payment form should have:
Cardholder's Name

Card Number (16-digit format)

Expiry Date (MM/YY)

CVV

Email

Billing Address

Payment Method (dropdown or radio buttons for Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, etc.)

A styled "Pay Now" button with animation

Add hover/focus/transition effects

Responsive design (mobile + desktop)

❗ All should work only on frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No backend needed.
