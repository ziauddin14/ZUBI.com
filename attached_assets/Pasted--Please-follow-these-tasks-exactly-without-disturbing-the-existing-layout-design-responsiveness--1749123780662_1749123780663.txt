 Please follow these tasks exactly, without disturbing the existing layout/design/responsiveness:

Select Payment Method (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal, Stripe, etc.)

After clicking “Pay Now”, show a confirmation screen + redirect user to a new page:

Show order date, item name, total amount, etc.

📬 2. Contact Us Page:
Update contact form details as below:

📄 3. About Us Page:
In footer, change “ShopHub” to ZUBI

When user clicks About Us, open a full About Us Page with this content (already provided):

[Use the previous About Us content you wrote for me, with styling and animation]

🔐 4. Add 2 Legal Pages:
Create 2 new styled pages accessible from footer:

🔹 Privacy Policy
Add a full privacy policy page for ZUBI with sample policy structure:

LocalStorage disclaimer

🔸 Terms of Service
Add a full terms of service page:

✍️ 5. Blog Section:
Add "Blog" link in navbar and footer

Clicking on Blog should open a new blog page

Include at least 2–3 sample blog posts with:

Title

Date

Author

Content

Image 

Use cards/sections layout and light animation

🛒 6. Product System Enhancement:
Total number of products: 100

Show only 6 products on home page

 “Start Shopping” or “Shop Now” button to go to full shop page

Shop page must:

Show all 100 products

Have category-based filter (at least 12 categories)

Show only selected category products when clicked

🗂️ 7. Category Fix:
Current category links on homepage do nothing — fix this:

When a category is clicked (e.g., Electronics, Clothing...), filter and show only that category’s products dynamically

Use JavaScript and localStorage only

🔍 8. Activate Search Bar in Navbar:
Search should be fully functional

Match typed keyword with product names

If found, show the product(s)

If not found, show a friendly message like:
❌ “Sorry, this product is currently not available in our store.”

🧱 9. Design/Style/Responsiveness:
Maintain the current layout/design

Make sure all newly added pages and features are:

Mobile-friendly

Smoothly animated

Stylish and clean

Use same color scheme, shadows, cards, fonts
